Terminal-BASIC is a lightweight BASIC-like language interpreter for
microcontroller-based systems.  It was inspired by the TinyBASIC port
for popular 8-bit AVR uc boards.

Arduino mega 2560-like boards are primary target for this project.
However the source code is not an arduino-ide sketch, but the set
of Netbeans C/C++ IDE projects. Moreover projects depend on the
arduino-ide and uses its toolchain.

1. Build from sources

Full source code is available at https://bitbucket.org/starling13/ucbasic/
and https://sourceforge.net/p/terminal-basic/

The script ./make_sketch.sh makes an archive with arduino-ide sketch
from source tree. It depends on the arduinoext library, which is being
hosted at https://bitbucket.org/starling13/libarduinoext/
(it should be placed at the same directory, where terminal-basic
directory is placed i.e.
   .../REPO/-|
             |-terminal-basic from https://bitbucket.org/starling13/ucbasic/
             |-libarduinoext from https://bitbucket.org/starling13/libarduinoext/ )

Use netbeans 8.2 IDE to work with sources. Building for PC (using
linux Arduino API emulation library) depends
on posixcpp library from https://bitbucket.org/starling13/posixcpp/
installed.

2. Terminal-BASIC language

Primary goal for project is a support of ANSI/ECMA Minimal BASIC
standards.

A set of sources for test programs can be downloaded from
https://cloud.mail.ru/public/45SG/gGc2kFpBk

The language, which ucBASIC will support one day is:
