# terminalbasic-arduino
Terminal-BASIC is a lightweight interpreter of classical BASIC programming language (unstructured with line numbers).

Main project repository is placed at https://github.com/terminal-basic-team/terminalbasic, but the sources structure is relatively complex, consisting from
several netbeans-ide projects and scripts for authoring of the sources. Here I place all the published versions in the form of Arduino-IDE sketches.
